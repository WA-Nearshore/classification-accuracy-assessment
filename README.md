# Create Custom Accuracy Assessment Points
## Gray McKenna | WA DNR Nearshore Habitat Program

### Overview
This tool calculates the minimum number of accuracy assessment sample points required to meet the user-specified confidence interval, based on the equation described in Congalton & Green 2019. It is for **binary** (2-class) classification products ONLY. Optionally, the user can specify a minimum number of points per class (50 recommended). These points will be distributed using an equal stratified random approach, and the remaining points will be distributed proportionally according to class cover using a stratified random approach. This points distribution method is appropriate when the producer is primarily interested in the lowest cover class. This was designed for accuracy assessments of floating kelp classification products. **Spatial Analyst license extension required.**
